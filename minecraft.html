<h2>Minecraft Sculpture</h2>

<p>Behold! The dragon I have composed on Minecraft on only my second day (as in real days) of using it. This dragon is directly based off a character named Ao Lie from the Lego Show called Monkie Kid: Journey to the West, which is based in China. The character from that show is pulled from the Journey to the West novel written in 16th century China by Wu Cheng'en. The main character is the mischievous monkey king known as Sun Wukong; he has because an iconic figure in various forms of media. This dragon is one of his companions as he ventures out to the west, and is known in the novel to be the White Dragon Horse. Of course, in the Lego Monkie Kid version, the dragon is less horse-like and more green, which is what I was going for instead. There are still some aspects of white, as shown in the dragons belly and eyes. Eastern/Chinese dragons in general hold a strong cultural significance as they are known to be majestic beasts that bring prosperity to the land; some people even worship them to this day. </p>
